    <h1>A mechanical engineer, electrical engineer, chemical engineer, and computer engineer</h1>
    <p>
        One day, a mechanical engineer, electrical engineer, chemical engineer, and computer engineer were driving down the street in the same car when it broke down.<br>
        The mechanical engineer said, I think a rod broke.<br>
        The chemical engineer said, The way it sputtered at the end, I think it's not getting enough gas.<br>
        The electrical engineer said, I think there was a spark and something's wrong with the electrical system.<br>
        All three turned to the computer engineer and said, What do you think?<br>
        The computer engineer said, I think we should all get out and then get back in.!
